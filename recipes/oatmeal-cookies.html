    <h1>Perfect Oatmeal Cookies</h1>

    <h2>Why Are These Oatmeal Cookies So Perfect?</h2>
    <p>Happy Friday! I’m so excited to share these oatmeal cookies with you today because they truly are the best. A few weeks ago, I got an intense craving for a good oatmeal raisin cookie. I ran to the kitchen and hastily threw together ingredients that I happened to have on hand and, without really measuring, I made some ok oat-ball kind of cookies. They halfway hit the spot, but my craving continued. So when I flipped through Sarah Copeland’s beautiful new book Every Day is Saturday, her oatmeal cookie recipe grabbed my attention.</p>
    <p>Sarah writes, “there are three kinds of oatmeal cookie: over-sugared and raisin-laden; too wholesome (a hippie cookie in disguise); and then these little nuggets of joy you can’t stop eating – that just right kind of cookie. These live in the third camp: sugar under control, but present, and no skimping on the butter (although I used coconut oil and they were still perfect). Cinnamon and vanilla give these big flavor. And for the sweet-toothed, a sprinkling of raisins, and buttery pecans (I used walnuts) do the trick.”</p>
    <p>My personal verdict? These cookies totally hit the spot! They were exactly what I was craving, the only problem is that they disappeared too quickly!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coconut oil or butter, melted</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup whole rolled oats</li>
        <li>3/4 cup raisins</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts, optional
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, sugar, whole egg, egg yolk, and vanilla, whisking vigorously.</li>
        <li>Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir in the oats, raisins, and walnuts, if using, folding into a tight batter. Set the dough aside for 20 minutes while the oven preheats. (Note: if your dough seems too wet to become scoop-able, chill it in the fridge for this 20 minutes and it'll firm up). If your dough is too crumbly, stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons water.</li>
        <li>Scoop into 20 tablespoon-sized balls and roll lightly in barely damp hands to make them round. Spread out onto the prepared baking sheets and bake until puffed, golden, and a touch underbaked-looking, 10 to 11 minutes. Let cool on the pans for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
