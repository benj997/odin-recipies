    <h1>Best Homemade Brownies</h1>

    <h2>Why Are These The Best Homemade Brownies?</h2>
    <p>For years, I couldn’t seem to find a recipe for brownies that met my standards. Anytime I made homemade brownies, I wanted them to be just like the ones I ate as a kid – super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, with crispy edges and crackly tops. But the thing is, these brownies didn’t come from a recipe. We always made them from a box. Nowadays, I prefer to bake from scratch, but no brownie recipe I tried could live up to the chocolate brownies of my childhood.</p>
    <p>So this fall, as I flipped through Michelle Lopez’s new book Weeknight Baking, her recipe for Boxed Mix Brownies, From Scratch caught my eye. Would I finally be able to make homemade brownies that would be just as delicious as the ones from a box?</p>
    <p>The verdict: yes! I’ve had this brownie recipe on repeat since the first time I tried it. It calls for basic pantry ingredients, and it’s hardly more difficult than using a mix. As for the brownies, they’re true perfection – glossy, fudgy, and filled with rich chocolate flavor. Trust me, you’re going to want to make them ASAP!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>
    </ol>
